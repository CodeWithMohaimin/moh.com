                Python is a high-level programming language used for general-purpose software engineering. It’s a server side language – which means it runs on the server, and is responsible for processing the logic behind user inputs, interacting with databases and other servers, etc.
                <br><br>
                Initially developed in the late 1980’s by Guido Van Rossum, Python has been around for decades alongside other server side languages like Java and C. Van Rossum modeled Python after the English language, eliminating unnecessary syntax to make it easier to read and write than other programming languages.
                <br><br>
                Python is an open-sourced language, and in recent years has increased in popularity due to its use in data science. Python also has a strong community around machine learning, data modeling, data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), with extensive resources and libraries built for these purposes.
                <br><br>
                And yes, the rumors are true. Python is named after the British comedy group Monty Python. Which in our opinion makes it all the more awesome.
                <br><br>
                Indeed if you decide to learn Python, you shall code with the strength of many men, Sir Knight.

            <h1>01. Python is extremely versatile, with multiple uses</h1>
            <p>
                    Just to name a few of its most common uses, Python is used in Data Mining, Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Web Development, Web Frameworks, Embedded Systems, Graphic Design applications, Gaming, Network development, Product development, Rapid Application Development, Testing, Automation Scripting, the list goes on.
                    <br><br>
                    Python is used as an easier and more efficiently-written alternative to languages that perform similar functionalities like C, R and Java.Therefore Python is growing in popularity as the primary language for many applications.
                    <h2>Python uses in Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>
            </p>    
            <p>       
                    Historically, the R programming language is most commonly used for data science. As Python code is considered easier to maintain and more scalable than R, Python has increased in popularity for data science – especially among professionals without advanced education in statistics or mathematical fields.
                    <br><br>
                    In the past few years, many packages have been developed for data analysis and machine learning using Python. This includes numpy and pandas, which allow users to understand and transform data; tensorflow, which is used to code machine learning algorithms; and pyspark, an API for working with Spark – a framework for easily working with large data sets.
                    <br><br>
                    These libraries enable your every day web developer to analyze large data trends, without having to learn the ins and outs of the more complex R.

                <h1>2. Python is the fastest growing programming language</h1>
                <p>
                    Given Python’s uses across many industries and applications – and its recent explosive use in data science, machine learning and AI, Python is on a major growth trajectory.
                    <br><br>
                    Stackoverflow.com shows Python as the fastest growing major programming language by a long-shot, by analyzing the number of visitors vs. questions about a certain topic.

                    The TIOBE Index is an indicator of a programming language’s popularity based on the quantity of search queries across 25 search engines, as well as the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses, and third party vendors. Currently, Python is #3 in the TIOBE Index, preceded only by C and Java.
                    <br><br>
                    TIOBE named Python the 2020 programming language of the year for gaining the most popularity of any language in 2020. Notably, this is the fourth time Python earned this distinction, which is a record for TIOBE. Python made a positive jump of 2.01% in 2020 (source: TIOBE).
